[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m not a writer but I actually did something\u0026hellip; This blog is not my first one. I started blogging in 2014 back when I was a graduation student with low resources (money+time) and the only thing I had was passion about electronics. My first blog is called \u0026ldquo;Embedded Systems Platform\u0026rdquo; and the funny part is that it\u0026rsquo;s still active through blogspot platform. It was nice platform to write but bugged as f0ck with low quality render on mobile platforms. On this blog, I tried from wireless firmware to hardware hacking and some network level protocols, I think during that time, hardware was very far from something I could imagine to work with. Usually for me hardware was PCBs and analog things, never had the impression I could design something like ASICs.\nAfter that I moved to ghost platform, something hundreds of years better to edit, review and publish posts full of links and images. This blog was part of my transition from software to hardware definitely (you can see clearly that by the last posts I was writing). Now with the url https://blog.aignacio.com, an amazing bought domain that I still pay to godaddy (btw, as the time is passing they increase more and more the price \u0026ndash;')\nThis blog was better but to manage such infrastructure I had to deal with Traefik, Portainer, Docker and a bunch of other complementary things like reverse proxy, nginx, etc\u0026hellip;Well I\u0026rsquo;m also not mentioning the monthly server bill to host all these softwares that I was barely using.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a not a full stack / devops engineer\u0026hellip; This is the main reason why my last blog was abandoned, I was tired and sick of updating all the softwares and keeping track manually of versions. Writing a post about HDL was out of my scope once that every time just to access the platform it was a chaos. Thus I left it all with the hope of one day returning back with a simpler platform, or a easy way of writing and publishing it without needing to read 1000 tutorials about how to handle new errors.\n\u0026hellip;and so we have github pages! Well, now once more again, I will try to return creating new posts but with more focus on what I\u0026rsquo;m working with, hardware more precisely HDL and FPGAs. This platform of github pages + hugo is so much easier than my previous solution that I got excited just to give a try and see how it goes. So far, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to test it and start writing again!\nbut why blogging? I mean, you aren\u0026rsquo;t making money with it! A friend of mine asked me this question and I think it worth to summarize some of the reasons why, in my toilet opinion, I think it worth blogging:\n I\u0026rsquo;m not a native english speaker: I think this one is pretty clear once you see my non-singular recurrent typos =). Because of that I think blogging can help to practice it more and helps to improve the brain parser for lexical errors or just writing skills. Sharing knowledge makes you learn: I had several mind blowing moments while trying to transfer knowledge to people that I realize how important is to share it through a post. Every time you think and convert this thinking into words, you see the path you went through and you reinforce such connections more and more\u0026hellip;If you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, try to have a training with an old engineer and see how easy all the sequence of instructions will come out of his mouth. Unless you have a SSD in your brain, it\u0026rsquo;ll take time to remember: Sometimes when you are trying to do a side project you can risk and have nice insights of proposals that may not be feasible for you to try while at your work. Thus having a post or a repository with all the steps and information may help you to solve it faster rather than starting again from scratch.  That\u0026rsquo;s the sum of my thoughts and the reason why I abandoned for 2 years this. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes this time\u0026hellip; ","permalink":"https://aignacio.com/posts/others/return/","summary":"Why blogging","title":"Return blogging"}]
